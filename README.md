# LocalSearch
Task 1 - AI final report




a) Task 1 (3.0 point(s)): Local Search
Descriptions:
Given a multivariable function
𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) = sin +𝑥4- + cos +𝑦4- − sin +𝑥16 ⋅ 𝑦- + cos 516 𝑥!6 + sin 516 𝑦!6
Requirements:
1. (0.5 point(s)): Draw a 3D surface to illustrate the given function f using the
sympy library, for instance,
After executing the algorithm, draw a red path to illustrate visited points along the
search path.
2. (2.0 point(s)): Implement the Hill Climbing algorithm to search for the location
(x, y) with the largest f-value, starting from O (0, 0),
o Propose an approach to immediately, O(1), determine the best neighbor.
o Propose an approach to control the step size of movement (the distance
between the current state and the selected neighbor).
o Propose an approach to deal with the case there is no better neighbors.
3. (0.5 point(s)): Organize the program regarding to the OOP model, ensure source
code is compact and reasonable.
